Friends: The Stuff You’ve Never Seen
Hosted by: Conan O’Brien


This is a special out takes episode. The cast and Conan are sitting around the set of Central Perk, talking about the stuff we’ve never seen.

Transcriber’s Note: This is stuff we never saw from all of the seasons, so for all of the scene settings I will be using the current arrangements. Even though some of the out takes take place when Chandler was living with Joey and Rachel was living with Monica, when Joey and Chandler were living in Monica and Rachel’s, and the current arrangements.

[Scene: Central Perk, the cast of Friends along with Conan O’Brien are sitting and talking.]

Conan: It’s a tradition here on Friends after every taping for me to hang out with you guys, (They all laugh) talk down the episode umm… The point of this whole thing is what people see in America is: they see Friends, they love the show, it looks like a smooth running machine, but behind the scenes there’s deceit, mistrust, and hate. And I thought, I thought we’d actually take a look at uh, y’know some of these moments where you guys are—there are mistakes. You make mistakes.

Jennifer: Once and a while.

Lisa: From time to time.

Conan: For example, I don’t have to memorize lines. You guys actually have to remember what to say and you probably forget from time to time. Yes?

Matthew: Our energy just comes way up when there’s an audience here and when that happens, something happens between your brain and your mouth sometimes and it just doesn’t, it just doesn’t work.

[Cut to Central Perk, Ross, Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler are there. I think it’s The One With The Joke.]

Ross: Uh, oh-oh, umm no you didn’t. I did.

Chandler: Oh uh-uh, no-no-no-no-uh-uh. (He starts laughing, causing everyone else to laugh.)

[Cut to Joey and Rachel's, Phoebe is talking. It looks like when Rachel and Monica lived in this apartment.]

Phoebe: ‘Xcusa seniora, voulez-bere quakay—[Beep]—uck it!

Matt: Wow Pheebs, you-you speak gutter?

[Cut back to the cast and Conan.]

Conan: You still get nervous everybody just before a show?

Matthew: Absolutely.

Lisa: Everybody.

Courtney: It’s amazing like all week long we’ve-we’ve been saying the same lines and then the audience is here and we will mess up, and if you mess up once, then you’ll get nervous because you’ll—you know you’ll probably mess up again.

[Cut to Central Perk, first season Monica is talking.]

The Director: Action!

Monica: (holding her hand in front of her face) When you were little you slept through-through the Grand Canyon.

The Director: Watch again that hand.

Courtney: This’ll be five/ten takes.

The Director: Okay.

Courtney: Okay. You know it’s gonna happen.

The Director: Once again, and action!

Monica: (the hand’s still there) When-when you were little you slept through the Grand Canyon. (She actually itches her nose this time.)

Courtney: Oh! Okay! I’m gonna try it without the coffee cup ‘cause I think it’s the left hand that’s messing me up.

[Cut to Joey and Rachel's, Joey is giving Chandler the bracelet from season 2.]

Joey: Hey and, this is a little extra something for y’know, always being there for me.

Matthew: Hey Joey! The camera hit our wall!

Matt: What?!

[Cut to Monica and Chandler's, Chandler and Joey are living here and Ross is writing on the Magna-Doodle when Rachel opens the door causing the door knob to hit his hand.]

Matt: I have had some clumsy moments I guess you can call ‘em.

[Cut to Central Perk, to the theme from The Dick Van Dyke show Joey runs into Central Perk carrying a stack of Soap Opera Digests and falls on the step. He does bounce right back up making it all that much funnier.]

[Cut back to the cast and Conan.]

Lisa: He fell down once! And we re-did it and we went back. And he—(laughs)—he was afraid he was gonna fall down…

Conan: You could actually see him trying not to fall down.

[Cut to Central Perk, same as before Joey is entering.]

Joey: Pheebs! (He looks down as he goes down the step to make sure he didn’t fall again.) Check it out! (He starts laughing when he realized what he did.)

[Cut back to the cast and Conan.]

Courtney: This particular time when he continued to fall or y’know, try not to fall, I was in the room with Matthew and Matthew was like, "Should I do it?"

[Reset from before, Matt doesn’t fall or look down.]

Joey: Pheebs! Check it out! Check it out! Check it out! Check it out! (Hands her one.)

Phoebe: Ooh, Soap Opera Digest!

(As she’s saying that Joey is to pull out a chair and sit down, only Matthew comes running in from off camera and dives for the same chair.)

[Cut back to the cast and Conan.]

Conan: Matthew, you have a reputation with the rest of the cast that sometimes you like to, you like to fool around a bit. I mean like if something’s naturally going wrong you like to get in there and juice it a little bit. True or false?

Matthew: I don’t necessarily like to juice things…

Courtney: He said true or false!

[Cut to Monica’s restaurant kitchen, it’s the episode where Joey is working as a waiter at Monica’s restaurant. Joey is patting her breast from when she set it on fire.]

Joey: Oh! Ooh-ooh!

Monica: What are you doing?!

Joey: You’re still a tiny bit on fire there.

Monica: Oh geez! Okay! Thanks!

(Matthew runs in and starts patting the other breast, then walks away. Matt slowly stops patting her breast.)

[Cut to that same kitchen, only this is The One With The Proposal, Richard is telling Monica something.]

Richard: It was great seeing you the other night.

Monica: Well, it was good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?

Richard: Noo! I came down here to tell you something else. I came here to tell you I still love you.

(Suddenly the door flies open and in walks Chandler!!)

Chandler: What the fu—(beep)—ck are you doing?!

Rachel: Okay. Okay, see now the one with the feather boa? That’s Dr. Francis. She used to be a man. Oh look! There—(Marcel (Katie) jumps away)—Okay. (And runs behind her on the back of the couch for a little while.)

Jennifer: Katie. Geez! See Katie, come here—Katie! (Katie spills some popcorn.) Katie, come here Katie. (She obeys and sits where she’s supposed to.) Very good.

[Reset, they’re about to start the scene when Katie suddenly jumps up startling Jennifer.]

[Cut to Joey and Rachel's, it’s actually Joey and Rachel’s. Phoebe is trying to convince Rachel to switch with her and live with Monica as Joey looks on.]

Rachel: No y’know, I don’t want to switch! Come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!

Phoebe: Well at Monica’s you can eat—(Suddenly cracks up.)

Jennifer: (to Lisa) Ready?

Lisa: Yeah.

(They all start laughing.)

[Cut back to the cast and Conan.]

Conan: And then it just builds on itself and there’s no doing the scene after. I mean you probably wait and really get it together and do it.

David: For me, I have a hard time with le Blanc in particular. When-when—I mean when…

Conan: (to Matt) You bastard.

Matt: Yeah, what did I do?

David: …I keep a straight face he-he delivers like this look, a reaction to you, or a certain take, I-I—I mean I find it so funny.

[Cut to Monica and Chandler's, Monica is throwing a party. Joey is talking to Ross about the bad audition he just had while pouring booze onto a snow cone.]

Joey: I mean what kind of an actor, what kind of an actor can’t even say, "Hmm, noodle soup?"

(David smiles.)

Matt: That’s a good one? (They both laugh.)

David: Now, we should go back and take the other line.

Matt: Okay, I’ll just put a little more booze on there. (Pours some more on.)

Ben: (prompting her) What did we agree?

Jennifer: Okay…

[Cut back to the cast and Conan.]

David: The good thing about the young kids though, they’re completely unpredictable. Which is a lot of fun as an actor to respond with. But there was one story…

Jennifer: Oh little Ben.

David: Where the story was that I was anticipating that I would be around to hear my son’s first words spoken. But the scene was about that he wasn’t supposed to be able to speak and, uh for some reason when we started doing the show…

David: Yeah, he’s saying Da-Da.

[Cut back to the cast and Conan.]

Matt: And then sometimes during the show y’know but you’re like, the scene’s going one way but you’re just tempted to say something another time. Like, do you remember that one where Monica’s baking cookies in our old apartment?

Jennifer: She’s trying to intrigue us to hang out with her.

Matt: Yeah, she’s trying to waft the smell across the hall to get us to come hang out in her new place, and we’re sitting there eating pizza and I think it was you (Points to Lisa) that said…

[Cut to Monica and Chandler's, the scene described above.]

[Cut back to the cast and Conan.]

Conan: I-I heard some of you guys talking about this earlier, but sometimes there’s just a word that someone has to say that you’ll get hung up on. And it’ll just—the way you say the word is funny to everybody else.

[Cut to Monica and Chandler's, is the one where Rachel screwed up the desert and Ross and Joey are trying to enjoy it.]

Ross: That tastes like feet!

[Cut back to the cast and Conan.]

Matt: Sometimes the dialogue itself is just so funny and you’ll—we’ll be rehearsing during the week and you just—whatever-whatever the joke is; it’s so funny we can’t get through it in rehearsal and just…

Jennifer: You just know.

Matt: You-you mentally make a flag on it and you say, "Okay show night, I’m just—I’ll never be able to get through this."

Rachel: I’m sorry…

Ross: Excuse me, what?

(Matt turns back and looks and them, but instead of his next line he starts laughing.)

[Cut back to the cast and Conan.]

Conan: When you have to do physical business for a scene, I mean there must be; there must be a lot of funny moments when you have to physically do a task as part of a scene.

David: Yeah, Rachel, Chandler, and Ross had to try to get a couch up a stair—a very narrow New York stairwell and that was probably…I-I think it was the hardest I’ve-I’ve laughed in my life period.

[Cut to the scene described above.]
